1. Ruby must be installed.
2. Open a terminal emulator.
3. Run the `ruby {Path}/RPwG.rb` command.
4. Enter a password length.
5. [Optional] Enter `yes` if you want the password to exclude characters differing from qwerty to azerty keyboards.
6. Enjoy your copy-pastable password! [Because, yeah, it sounds like much fun to generate a password you won't even be able to memorize before 72 days, time at which most services force you to change password. But you can't complain now!: you've got a **random password generator**!]
