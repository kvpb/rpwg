                      Random Password Generator  1.00

                              Instructions Manual

          RPwG is a franco-US-american -- 'QWAZERTY' -- random password 
generator. This program written in Ruby pseudorandomly generates passwords whose
length and US QWERTY-FR AZERTY portability are at the user's discretion. NB: 
Ruby must be installed.
          An online version 2 was planned to have a GUI written in HTML5, CSS3 
and JavaScript, mimicking a powered-on Twiggy Mac in which only enter the 
password's length and set its 'qwazertyness' --- to unrestrict users from Ruby 
as a requirement. Albeit the graphic design part is 100% done, the development 
has been canceled until further notice.
          The files in this zip archive constitute the first official release of
the RPwG program. Currently, they are not documented. RPwG has been designed so 
that it is self-explanatory. There are a few points which should be noted, 
particularly by any novice user.

          1.	Launch a terminal emulator, e.g. Terminal.
          2.	Drag-and-drop the RPwG.rb file into the terminal emulator's 
            	window.
          3.	Press Enter.
          4.	Follow the on-screen instructions.
          5.	Enjoy your copy-pastable password!

          Should problems arise with this software, please communicate them to 
the author, or open an issue at https://github.com/kvpb/RPwG/issues.
